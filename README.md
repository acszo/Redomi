## Description

Don't you hate when you receive music links from friends who use different platforms than you (they always use the bad ones ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž) and you can't tap and play them in your favourite music service???? <br/>
This app is here to solve that problem! <br/>
And you can also share the songs you want to anyone by converting the link to their preferred platform. <br/> <br/>
<b> All of this is done like it's integrated into your system! </b>

## Features

- Open supported links from different music services in your favourite streaming app
- Convert links and share songs with others on their preferred platforms
- Customize Sharesheet in different ways:
  - Icon shapes
  - Choose which apps to display
  - Decide between a horizontal or vertical list, and its grid size
- Material You
- Light/Dark Theme

## HOW TO MAKE IT WORK

By default Redomi is unable to open links, do as follows:
1. Long-press on Redomi and open its info page
2. Navigate to "Set/Open by default" (this may have a different naming on some devices)
3. Check all the music platforms that are *NOT* installed

## Supported services (+ 3rd party apps)

- Youtube music
- Youtube
- Spotify
- Deezer
- Tidal
- Amazon Music
- Apple Music
- Soundcloud
- Napster

3rd party clients are also compatible, as long as they're the default app to handle the corresponding link

Obviously [Song.link](https://song.link/) or else it would have not been possible, and also [Ty3uK/songlink-android](https://github.com/Ty3uK/songlink-android) for giving me inspiration
