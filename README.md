## Description

Don't you hate when your friend uses a different music platform than you (they always use the mid ones ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž) and you can't open it in your favourite app or viceversa???? <br/>
This app got you covered, you will be able to click on those links and see the song open in your favourite music streaming service! <br/>
And you will also be able to share the song you want to anyone by converting the link to their prefered platform <br/> <br/>
<b> All of this is done like it's integrated into your system! </b>

## Features

- Open supported links from different services into your favourite one
- Share song by converting it to different available services
- Customize Bottom Sheet in different ways:
  - Choose which apps you want to see and their order 
  - Decide between a horizontal or vertical list, and it's grid size
- Material You
- Light/Dark Theme

## HOW TO MAKE IT WORK

By default Redomi can't open external links, to do so long press on the app's icon and open the info page,
from there open "Set/Open by default" (might be called a bit differently on some devices), and then check all the
music platforms *THAT ARE NOT INSTALLED*

## Supported services (+ 3rd party apps)

- Youtube music (+ Revanced, InnerTune, ViMusic)
- Youtube (+ Revanced, NewPipe, LibreTube)
- Spotify
- Deezer
- Tidal
- Amazon Music
- Apple Music
- Soundcloud
- Napster

## What still needs to be done?

- Reordering apps
- Vertical list needs to pin first row and then expand on scroll

Sometimes the song.link is slow to convert songs

Obviously [Song.link](https://song.link/) or else it would have not been possible, and also [Ty3uK/songlink-android](https://github.com/Ty3uK/songlink-android) for giving me inspiration
